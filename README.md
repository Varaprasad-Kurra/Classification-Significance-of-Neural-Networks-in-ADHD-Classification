# Classification-Significance-of-Neural-Networks-in-ADHD-Classification

A Neural Networks based Machine Learning application to calculate classification significance of Neural Networks.

A copartive study on different Neural Networks like RNN, CNN and LSTM. 

At the end of the study we prove that LSTM with its ability to hold the output of the previous input we prove LSTM are better compared to different Neural Networks.
